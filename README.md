A few things to note:
- This prototype is a throwaway build ; it's meant to be discarded, it's not the final project, the engine we'll use is probably going to be different, all assets are very much placeholder. Its one and only purpose is to show the format I have in mind.
- What is described in the GDD and what is represented in the prototype is only the skeleton of the project ; it's empty, shallow and barebones. The next goal after validating this base will be to build upon it to bring in the "fun" component. Lore, game mechanics, and bonus points if it's an obscure Michi reference!
- This prototype has been designed around a full run of roughly 5 to 10 minutes, because I'm not going to make you play 10 hours for a digital taste-test. If we're going for the philosophy of a side-pet to keep open next to a Michi stream, the game will of course have to be paced much slower and designed not to require constant attention.
- The settings menu and credits scene are missing, I haven't worked on them. So instead the buttons will make an authoritative quack. I didn't work much on the save system either. The save system won't quack though.
- graphic design is my passion.
